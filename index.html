<h1 class="tabset tabset-fade tabset-pills">What’s the story?</h1>
<p><strong>We’ve looked at the numbers of children needing support for
‘Speech, language and communication needs’ in primary schools. In
particular, children in Year 1, who were at pre-school age during the
lockdowns of the 2020/21 academic year.</strong></p>
<p>Speech and language is the biggest category of special educational
need (SEN), accounting for more than half of year 1 children needing SEN
support, and has experienced one of the biggest increases in the last
year.</p>
<p>The number of children needing speech and language support in the
first year of school has risen 10% - three times that of recent rises,
BBC analysis shows.</p>
<p>The increase is partly down to the effect of lockdown restrictions
according to experts.</p>
<p>The Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists said the
profession was struggling to cope with the demand.</p>
<p>The government said it was putting £180m into early years
development.</p>
<p>Analysis by the BBC’s Shared Data Unit found the number of five and
six-year-olds needing help with language increased more than most other
areas of special educational needs.</p>
<p>A total of 42,341 children required extra support in 2021/22, up from
38,560 in 2020/21.</p>
<p>The charity Speech and Language UK said this could have been down to
the lack of stimulus available to young children during the
pandemic.</p>

class="section level3">
<h3>Kamini Gadhok, Chief Executive of the Royal College of Speech,
Language, Therapists (RCSLT)</h3>
<p><strong>Q: Why is it so important children don’t fall behind in terms
of their language development?</strong></p>
<p>A: “I think communication is the bedrock of all our learning, both
social and emotional, as well as educational learning. Our interaction
with our families and communities, and most importantly, for young
children as well, making friends. And if we don’t support children who
have needs early on, we do know that they go on to have, or can go on to
have significant needs as they get older.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How important is it that we get it right from the
beginning?</strong></p>
<p>A: “So if you’re looking at educational attainment, we know that at
the age of five your children have difficulties with communication. They
are six times less likely to reach the expected standard of English.
That’s you know, in itself shocking. But if you then look at other areas
of development, such as behaviour. We know that over eighty percent of
children with behaviour problems have previously un-identified speech
and language difficulties, and then things like mental health, which we
know is a really big priority.</p>
<p>“But children with mental health problems are three times more likely
to have communication needs. So you know It’s really important that we
support children early on, and they continue to get the support they
need.</p>
<p>“It’s very important to note that more than ten percent of children
have long term speech, language and communication needs. So these are
children who are not going to just grow out of it. They’re going to need
support through their education and to help them with accessing the
curriculum, which is a really big part of what speech, language
therapists do with schools.</p>
<p><strong>Q: So we’ve looked at the data, across the country there is
an increase in the number of children with a speech, language, and
communication needs - is it a worry?</strong></p>
<p>A: “It is a real worry. Our members have been telling us anecdotally
that they’ve been seeing a huge increase in the number of children
referred to them. We’ve been very aware, from the surveys we’ve done,
that the pandemic has had an impact, not just because of services being
closed or schools not being open, but also because children were not
able to interact that they, as in a way that they used to.</p>
<p>“It’s really important to remember that we learn to communicate by
socialising with other people. So for children and young people, it’s
being able to socialise with other children, to be able to mix with
family members, to be out and about in the community, or even simple
things like being in the playground. So all of those things where and
interactions were impacted during the pandemic. So, as I said, we were
very aware from our members that they were seeing more children being
referred.</p>
<p>“But I think the data actually now backs up that anecdotal
feedback.</p>
<p>“I think what’s really important as well is the latest data that we
have from the Department for Education is the number of children who’ve
been identified as having speech language difficulties which has gone up
by over ninety-four thousand since 2015/2016. So over ninety-four
thousand more children needing help. That’s a significant number of
children.”</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is there a solution to this?</strong></p>
<p>A: “Well, we’ve been raising concerns even pre pandemic, because
there was a situation within the profession, and for services that were
already very, very stretched. So we have seen a cut in funding to speech
and language services over the years. Children’s communication needs
have not been prioritized within government, and we were very concerned
about this. So what we are now seeing post pandemic, or actually, we
still obviously have an issue with the virus is that we’ve hit a crisis
point with services, where services are not able to meet the level of
demand that we’ve just talked about.</p>
<p><strong>Q: So are we actually creating a problem for the generation
coming behind – because of the backlog if it’s harder to access
services?</strong></p>
<p>A: “There is a significant backlog at the moment. Figures show that
for the Nhs there are more than seventy-four thousand children waiting
on a waiting list. We know by talking to our members who work in the
private sector that they do not have enough speech and language
therapists to meet the demand that’s out there. We know that for years
there’s been a lack of proper workforce planning, so there are not
enough speech there, because you’ve been trained over time, and we are
now listed as a shortage profession on the Home Office website. So there
is a real issue about trying to meet the levels of need that are now in
the system.”</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is there enough funding for schools to actually get speech
and language therapists on board to help?</strong></p>
<p>A: “I think this is something that we are hoping the government will
really look at very seriously. So both in terms of funding through
schools, but also very critically funding through the NHS. For many
years, as I said, children with communication needs have not been a
priority within the NHS. And, as you can imagine, when funding is tight,
If it’s not listed as a priority within the system, then that’s an area
which will potentially be cut rather than even invested in. And that’s
what we have seen over the years. There is an opportunity because the
NHS plan is going to be refreshed. So if we can get something in there
about meeting the needs of children with speech, language, communication
needs that would be really important, so that that creates the impetus
within local systems to work together with schools to ensure that we
work to provide the services that these children need.”</p>

<h3>Jane Harris, chief executive of Speech and Language UK</h3>
<p>Jane is calling for a free screening tool for schools to spot
problems early.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Otherwise, children end up with other labels. They get labelled with
mental health problems or behavioural problems, where as eighty percent
of children with behavioural and emotional difficulties actually have an
underlying speech and language challenge.”So if we can help schools and
nurseries to spot as many children as possible, that will really
help.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="department-for-education-response" class="section level3">
<h3>Department for Education response</h3>
<p>Up to £180 million of government funding over the next three years
will support the sector to focus on children’s development in their
earliest of years and help to address existing recruitment and retention
challenges. It follows commitments by the government to improve parents’
access to affordable, flexible childcare through ambitious reforms, for
which work continues.</p>
<p><strong>Minister for Schools and Childhood, Kelly Tolhurst,
said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The early years of a child’s life are vital, not only in
establishing important developmental skills, but also in building a
lifelong love of learning that will help them succeed in adult life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m really proud of the quality and dedication of our early years
workforce. This package of support is a huge investment in their skills
and professional development, because raising the status of this
important sector is key to its growth.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Nuffield Early Language Intervention (NELI) programme, which has
already helped to boost the speech and language skills of an estimated
90,000 children, will also continue this academic year.</p>
<p>The Department for Education, in partnership with the Department of
Health and Social Care, has also launched a new ‘Better Health - Start
for Life’ campaign, providing parents of children aged 0 to 4 with
practical advice and tips to help them develop their child’s language
and literacy skills before starting school. Funding from today’s
announcement will also support parents to gain additional advice through
new Family Hubs, expected to open in the first half of 2023.</p>
<p>The package of support, which will benefit pre-school children all
over England, includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early maths, language, and social development training for
10,0000 professionals through the third phase of the Professional
Development Programme (PDP3)</strong> – more than 1,300 professionals in
51 local authorities were provided with bespoke training designed to
support the learning and development of children affected by the
pandemic during the second phase of this programme, meaning around
20,000 children will have benefited from better trained, more confident
staff;</li>
<li><strong>The national rollout of the Expert and Mentors programme to
provide bespoke leadership support to 7,500 early years settings and
childminders</strong> to address the impact of the pandemic on children
in their care. This support is free and available across the country to
eligible settings. Around 200 settings across the North of England,
Lancashire and Yorkshire received support through a pilot of this
programme this Spring;</li>
<li><strong>Graduate-level specialist training</strong> leading to early
years teacher status - evidence is very clear that higher qualifications
are consistently identified as a predictor of higher quality and
associated with better child outcomes;</li>

<div id="could-there-be-other-reasons-for-the-change"
class="section level2">
<h2>Could there be other reasons for the change?</h2>
<p>We looked at other potential causes for the increase in speech,
language and communication needs. Those included:</p>
<ul>
<li>An increase in pupils</li>
<li>An increase in pupils with English as a second language (ESL)</li>
<li>A ‘bounce back’ after a drop in the previous year</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall pupil numbers in primary schools have been declining since
2018/19 from 4.73m in that year to 4.66m in 2021/22. Numbers in Year 1
have broadly declined over the same period. In 2021/22 there was a small
increase (0.8%) from 619,000 to 624,000 - returning to numbers similar
to 2019/20. However, this is much smaller than the increase in pupil
numbers needing language support in that year (10%).</p>
<p>Regardless of pupil numbers, the <em>proportion</em> of children in
Year 1 with speech and language needs has also seen an increase, from
6.2% in 2020/21 to 6.8% in 2021/22. This also represents a 10% increase
(0.6 is a tenth of 6.2) and double the increase seen in the previous
five years covered in the data (previous years have seen increases of
0.2 or 0.3 percentage points).</p>
<p>The numbers of pupils with English as a second language (ESL)
increased slightly between 2020/21 and 2021/22, from 3,367 to 3,419 -
but this 0.2% increase was less than the increase in overall pupil
numbers and so proportionally, the percentage of children with ESL
actually went down.</p>
